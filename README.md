## Excel File Translator
This Python script utilizes the googletrans library to translate text data in an Excel file from Chinese (zh-cn) to English (en). 
It accommodates both string and numeric columns, creating a new DataFrame with translated content. 
Any encountered translation errors are logged, and the resulting translated DataFrame is saved to a new Excel file.
